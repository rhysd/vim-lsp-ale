[vim-lsp][] + [ALE][]
=====================
[![Build Status][ci-badge]][ci]
[![Coverage Status][codecov-badge]][codecov]

Forked from [https://github.com/rhysd/vim-lsp-ale](rhysd/vim-lsp-ale) with minor tweaks to use
ALE's lsp response processing which results in better highlighting of errors, hover-text etc.

[vim-lsp-ale][] is a Vim plugin for bridge between [vim-lsp][] and [ALE][]. Diagnostics results received
by vim-lsp are shown in ALE's interface.

When simply using ALE and vim-lsp, both plugins run LSP servers respectively. Running multiple server processes
consume resources and may cause some issues. And showing lint results from multiple plugins is confusing.
vim-lsp-ale solves the problem.

## Installation

Install [vim-lsp][], [ale][ALE], [vim-lsp-ale][] with your favorite package manager or `:packadd` in your `.vimrc`.

An example with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```viml
Plug 'dense-analysis/ale'
Plug 'prabirshrestha/vim-lsp'
Plug 'rhysd/vim-lsp-ale'
```

## Usage

Register LSP servers you want to use with `lsp#register_server` and set `vim-lsp` linter to `g:ale_linters`
for filetypes you want to check with vim-lsp.

The following example configures `gopls` to check Go sources.

```vim
" LSP configurations for vim-lsp
if executable('gopls')
    autocmd User lsp_setup call lsp#register_server({
        \   'name': 'gopls',
        \   'cmd': ['gopls'],
        \   'allowlist': ['go', 'gomod'],
        \ })
endif

" Set 'vim-lsp' linter
let g:ale_linters = {
    \   'go': ['golint'], " vim-lsp is implicitly active
    \ }
```

This plugin configures vim-lsp and ALE automatically. You don't need to setup various variables.

When opening a source code including some lint errors, vim-lsp will receive the errors from language server
and ALE will report the errors in the buffer.

ALE supports also many external programs. All errors can be seen in one place. The above example enables
vim-lsp and golint.

For more details, see [the documentation](./doc/vim-lsp-ale.txt).
